### Hi, I'm Almir ðŸ‘‹

<hr>

<p> I'm a junior software / backend developer. Currently learning Java on CodeGym Online Java Bootcamp.
   Beside Java, I'm  also learning PHP&MySQL, and HTML and CSS(on the fly).    
</p>
<p>I prefer backend over frontend in development, so I'll be most focusing my learning on creating aplication with Spring&Hibernate and PHP&MySQL.</p>
